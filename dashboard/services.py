"""The numbers behind the dashboard — F62.

Read-only. Nothing here writes, and nothing here owns data: every figure is
recomputed from the app that does own it, so a tile can never disagree with
the screen it links to.

## The one rule worth stating

**Every figure is scoped to one warehouse.** The design has a warehouse
selector at the top and a heading naming the site, so "16,482 items" is
always "at Namayemba", never "in the country". Passing `warehouse=None`
returns the all-sites figure, which is what the two leads and Finance see.

Row-level scoping by role is the view's job, through
`scope_to_user_site()`. This layer takes a warehouse and answers for it.
