"""HTTP for the dashboard — F62.

Four read-only endpoints behind one screen. Views here do even less than
usual: resolve which warehouse is being asked about, call a service, return
it.

## Who sees this

The leads, Finance, and warehouse staff for their own site. **Not school
staff** — the checklist gives them a dashboard too ("own schools"), but the
tiles here are warehouse tiles: stock in bins, trucks loading, SKUs below
their floor. A school's dashboard is a different screen with different
numbers, and it is not built. Pretending this one serves them would give
them a page of figures about somebody else's warehouse.
