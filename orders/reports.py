"""Fulfilment reports — F49, F52, F54, F57.

Read-only views over documents that already exist. Nothing here writes.

## The one interpretation worth stating

Three of these turn on the phrase "packing list", which AsOne uses on p.8
and in the checklist:

    F52  "Pick lists generated but packing lists not yet created"
    F54  "School orders with a pick list but no packing list"

A packing list is the document that travels with the goods (F40), so it
comes into existence when a shipment does. That makes both of those the same
underlying question in this data model:

    an order that has been **picked** and has **no shipment yet**

Stated here rather than buried, because if AsOne means something else by
"packing list" — a separate step between picking and despatch — these two
reports change and F40 changes with them.

F52 and F54 are also very nearly the same report. They differ only in
audience: the checklist gives F54 to school staff for their own schools and
F52 not at all. Kept separate for that reason alone, and sharing one query
so they cannot drift apart.
