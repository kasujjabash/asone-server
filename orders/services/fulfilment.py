"""Filling a school order from a warehouse — F37, F38, F39.

Warehouse-facing, where the point of sale next door in pos.py is school-
facing. Split out because they are read and changed by different people, and
because one file holding both had grown past the ~300 lines this project
splits at.

Picking does not move stock out of the warehouse. It **recategorises** it:
out of Available, into Pick, at the same value. Total stock is unchanged;
what changes is how much of it is still free to promise to another order.
That is what reserving means in a ledger with no reservations table.

Moving stock out entirely is F41, and it is deliberately absent — the point
at which stock leaves is open question Q1, and AsOne's own chart says
"Shipped ???".
