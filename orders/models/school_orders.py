"""A school order — F30, F31, F32, F33.

One student's uniform, ordered by their school. Four features that read as
separate items on the checklist are really one document:

    F30  ordered at kit and/or item level
    F31  the student's name, as free text
    F32  created on Hold until payment is confirmed
    F33  a kit becomes its component SKUs for the warehouse to pick

Two things AsOne was explicit about (p.7):

**Students have no accounts.** The school is the customer and the ship-to
address. The student's name is a free-text field on the order, used with the
invoice number so the school can hand the right parcel to the right child.

**A school orders at kit or item level; the warehouse always picks SKUs.**
So a kit line is exploded into its components when the order is placed — and
that explosion is stored, not recomputed. If Central Office edits the kit's
bill of materials next term, an order placed today must still mean what it
meant today. Same reasoning as dated prices: a document records what was
true when it was written.
