"""Uniform Kits — bundles of SKUs sold as one unit.

AsOne's vocabulary: a Uniform Kit is what a school orders for a new student —
a fixed bundle of SKUs, e.g. a "PS Starter Kit" of one shirt, one tunic and a
pair of socks. The Point-of-Sale phase explodes a kit order into the SKUs
underneath it; this module only defines what is *in* a kit and what it costs.

**Kit price is never stored.** It is always the sum of the current prices of
the SKUs that make it up — see `compute_kit_price()` in catalog/services.py.
A stored total would go stale silently the moment one component's garment
was repriced, and nobody would notice until a school was invoiced the wrong
amount. Same reasoning as GarmentPrice; see catalog/models/pricing.py.
