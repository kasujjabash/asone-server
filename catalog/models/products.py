AsOne's vocabulary, from p.2 of the pack. Three words that sound similar and
are not:

    Garment  a uniform component. "White Shirt". About 45 of them.
    Size     a garment attribute. Each garment comes in four or five.
    SKU      one garment in one size. What is counted, ordered and picked.

Only the first two live here. The SKU is F06 and lands separately.

    price here makes that structurally impossible to violate, rather than a
    rule someone has to remember across ~200 SKU rows. The client's own

    it enforces their stated rule instead of their table shape.
