"""Business logic for master data.

Thin views, fat services. Everything here is callable from the API, the
admin, a management command or a test without going near HTTP.

Pricing is the substance of this module. Two rules drive all of it:

    A price applies over a period, not forever.
    A garment has at most one price on any given day.

The second is guaranteed by a database constraint, not by these functions —
see catalog/models/pricing.py. That is what lets `price_for()` return a single
value instead of a list and a judgement call.
