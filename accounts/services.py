    current access token expires, which is at most ACCESS_TOKEN_LIFETIME
    (30 minutes), and is then refused when it tries to refresh.

    Closing that last half hour needs a token version on the user checked by
    a custom authentication class, which is a database read on every single
    request forever. Not worth it for the risk this addresses: the point is

    requests cannot both spend one challenge — but a failed attempt is a
    fact that has to survive being refused.

    Raises ChallengeUnusable for anything meaning "start again" — unknown,
