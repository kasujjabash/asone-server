"""A physical count can land either side of the system figure.

F23 gave every reason code a fixed direction, which is right for the codes
AsOne named — a return always adds, damage always removes. A correction is
the exception: the shelf can hold more than the system thinks as easily as
less.

A single `CORR` fixed to DECREASE would let F24 post shortfalls and nothing
else, which is why migration 0006 splits it into `CORR_UP` and `CORR_DOWN`.
These tests exist so nobody merges them back together.
