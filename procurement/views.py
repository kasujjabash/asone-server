"""HTTP layer for ordering from the Tailoring Centers.

Two permission shapes appear here, and the difference is the whole point of
AsOne's matrix:

    Group orders      leads write, Finance reads. No warehouse involvement.
    Production orders leads write; warehouse staff work with **their own
                      warehouse's** orders; Finance reads all of them.

The second needs `scope_to_user_site()` as well as a permission class. A
permission class lets a Namayemba clerk open the production orders screen;
only scoping stops them reading Serere's.
